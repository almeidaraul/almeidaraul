Hi, I'm Raul Almeida. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at [UFPR](https://www.ufpr.br/portalufpr/) and use GitHub mostly for personal projects - although there'll be a university thing here and there.

You'll see most of the projects I update on my free time are built using React Native (check out [guessGame](https://github.com/almeidaraul/guessgame) and [How Much Insulin](https://github.com/almeidaraul/hmi)). I have also a growing interest for interface design, which you'll see expressed in current and future projects, and data analysis with Python - I use it for diabetes management ([here](https://github.com/almeidaraul/bsia)).

You can get in touch through my email (almeidaraulgp at gmail dot com) or see a little more about me on my webpage ([almeidaraul.github.io](https://almeidaraul.github.io)).
